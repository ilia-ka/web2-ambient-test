Act as a Senior Backend Engineer and Performance Specialist. I am participating in a "Web2 Developer Loop" challenge and need a robust, production-grade solution.

Here is the challenge context:
---
Challenge: “Stream a response end-to-end.”
Task: Implement streaming responses.
Measure: Time to first token (TTFT) and Time to completion (TTC).
Deliverable: Code snippet and Short latency notes for a Discord post.
Stretch goal: Run the same prompt against a closed API (OpenAI) and compare streaming behavior + latency.
---

Please execute the following steps to complete this task:

### Step 1: The Implementation (Server & Stream)
Write a backend code snippet using **[INSERT YOUR STACK HERE, e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, Go]**.
- Create an API endpoint (e.g., `/stream`) that simulates a streaming response (e.g., sends chunks of text with a slight delay to mimic LLM generation).
- Ensure headers are set correctly for streaming (e.g., `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` or `Content-Type: text/event-stream`).

### Step 2: The Benchmarking Script
Write a client-side script (in the same language or curl/bash) that connects to this endpoint and precisely measures:
1. **TTFT (Time to First Token):** The duration from the request start to the arrival of the first chunk of data.
2. **TTC (Time to Completion):** The duration from the request start to the closing of the connection.

### Step 3: The Stretch Goal (Closed API Comparison)
Extend the benchmarking script to perform the same measurements against the **OpenAI API** (using a standard streaming completion request).
- *Note: Assume I will provide the API Key via environment variables.*
- Compare the "Simulated Local Stream" vs. "OpenAI Stream" in terms of jitter and latency.

### Step 4: The Deliverable Artifact
Generate a concise, formatted summary ready to be copy-pasted into a Discord channel (`#developers`). It must include:
1. The core code snippet (use markdown code blocks).
2. A "Latency Notes" section comparing your local implementation vs. the external API.
3. A brief explanation of the "Streaming Behavior" observed (e.g., burstiness vs. smooth flow).

**Constraints:**
- Keep the code clean and readable.
- Add comments explaining *how* the streaming is achieved technically.
